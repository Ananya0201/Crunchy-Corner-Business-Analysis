#### ● Data arrangement :
The Data has 2 fact tables which is the actual unclean data and to make the data precise and readable for performing analysis. The below steps were followed while cleaning the data in excel:
a. The data is broken down into dimension tables and fact table which helps in creating data relationships for better and smooth readability of the data-

   ❖DIM_PRODUCT has the product details such as SKU Code number, SKU Description, Category, Sub Category, Product, Sub Product. I added a column "Product_ID" by first condensing the unique data for SKU's and removing duplicates. Then i assigned the a unique Product_Id to the SKU's. Next i used VLOOKUP to and added the Product_Id in the fact tables. This Step helped clean the data by only retaining the Product_ID in the fact tables and other details related to the Products are retained in the Dimension Table

   ❖DIM_Cluster has the names of the Cluster Head who are in-charge of the managerial decisions in that particular location. I removed the duplicates and retained only the unique data. Next we created a column - "Cluster_ID" and assigned a unique number for the Cluster_head. We used VLOOKUP to add the cluster Id to the fact tables.

   ❖DIM_Location has the geographical details wherein the company is operating. We condensed the data and removed the duplicates to retain unique data. We created an additional column - "Location_ID" and assigned a unique number for each location. Next We used VLOOKUP to add the Location Id to the fact tables.
   
   ❖DIM_Channel has the details of means of selling of the Product. There are 9 channels of selling and we have used similar steps as above to create the dimension table and added channel id on the fact tables using VLOOKUP.
   
   ❖DIM_Date has the details pertaining to year, month and quarter on which the sales were taking place. A "date_id" column was added to the fact table for which we first added a column converting the months column from text to numeric using IF clause. Next we created month_start_date column for which we used the "=Date" formula available in excel. Using the data in month_start_date column , we created a new column "month_end_date" and used "=EOMONTH" formula. This was done to ensure the date doesn't create an error when considering the Quarter column. After this, we used the concatenate function and joined the text strings in column - "Year", "Quarter", "month" to create a unique id and followed the same steps in the fact table column in order to use VLOOKUP and create "date_id" column. This was done so that any error with the formula can be avoided while considering all the three strings of text in the year, quarter and month column.

After tweaking and playing around with the data, it is now ready for analysis and if further transformation is needed, we will do it along the way.

#### ● Data modelling:
Loaded the data in Power Bi desktop, dataset is a xlxs file. Opened the data in power query, and in the view tab under Data preview section to ensure the data is in proper format and checking to see the column distribution, column quality and column profile, before loading it into the model. We made a few changes to the header column and then proceeded to the next step - Data modelling. In the Model View, the schema is a Star schema with 2 fact table and 5 dimension table. After establishing the table Relationships, allowing for complex data analysis, we proceeded to the report view. It was observed that in none of the columns, errors or empty values were present except in columns Tax, Interest income , Discount & Trade Spend in the Actuals fact Table. The Budgets fact table had errors in the "Product_id" column. The errors were removed in the "Budgets fact table" and the null values were not taken into account as only less than 4% values are null in the columns in the "Actuals Fact Table".

The Report view has 5 tabs : Home, Performance analysis, Cost Analysis, Budget Analysis, Business Optimization. In the report view, under Format, the canvas background was customized and the theme was selected from the view tab. In the Home Page, Page Navigator tab was added from the Insert tab displayed under Buttons. The Page Navigation button was customized as per the theme and action was added to toggle between the different dashboards from the Home Page.
Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named "Location", "Cluster head", "Channel" "Category", "Year", & "Month" for all tabs.
 
Two set of multi card visuals was added to the Performance analysis. One multi-card visual representing "Total SKU's", "EBITDA total for actual", "Net Revenue", "Gross Profit" , "Net Profit" and "Total Volume of Sales". The other card displays information regarding "YoY% changes in Sales Revenue", "YoY% changes in Sales Revenue YTD", "CY Sales YTD" & "PY Sales YTD".    Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used and Blank or null values were filtered out.

One Multi-card visual has been used for the Cost Analysis Dashboard representing values for "Raw material", "Marketing Cost", "G&A Cost", "S&D Cost", "Fixed and Variable Cost", "Trade and discount Cost". 

In the Budget Analysis Dashboard, one multi card visual with "CY Sales", "PY Sales", "Budgeted Sales", "% change in Budgeted Variance YoY" and "YOY% change in Sales revenue" has been added.            

#### ● Dax calculations and Chart development:
In order to meet business requirements, certain DAX calculations were made in order to accurately represent the numbers for the KPI. All created measures have been bifurcated per the fields used for calculations in the actuals or the budgets table. "All measures Budget" has all the measures used to write DAX Calculations with the numbers from the Budgets table . Same is for the " All measures Actuals". The Cost Analysis table has measures used in creating the "Cost Analysis" tab.

Following are the Dax expressions written to find various metrices:

CY Sales = SUM(Actual[Net Revenue])

-As per the KPI requirement, in the Performance analysis tab, A clustered bar chart was added to the report design area representing "Sales YoY", a donut chart was added to represent "CY Sales by Category". Next a Stacked Bar Chart was added to represent trend in "Net Revenue, Gross Profit, EBITDA, PAT yearly", a clustered column chart to Show Sales by Location & Channel and a clustered line and column chart to represent net sales by PAT% , EBITDA% and GP%.

-In the Cost Analysis tab, Four Charts are added - A Funnel Chart to analyze the cost incurred yearly on various expenses. Two dynamic donut charts representing "expenses by category & Location"2 is added with a slicer for Operating Cost and Non-operating Cost. One clustered line and column chart is added to visualise the "raw materials-to-sales ratio". This ratio helps assessing how much raw material is being used relative to the sales generated for the given year. A lower ratio indicates more efficient use of materials, while a higher ratio suggest excess inventory or inefficient production processes.

-In the Budget Analysis Tab, 5 charts have been developed. One clustered line and column chart that represents "Current years Sales vs Budgeted sales and the variance % YOY by Location". A scatter plot Showing YoY% variance in Sales by Product, Line chart showing CY Sales ,PY sales and Budgeted Sales on a monthly basis, Line chart representing Sales with forecast and a table showing figures and the Sales figure and variance breaking down into categories of product and sku's for indepth analysis.

- In Business Optimization, 3 chart- A Marimekko Chart for Sales by category and % of Sku generating the sales, Scatter Plot for Top Category by GP and NR and a Line and Clustered column chart to display Gross Profit & Volume Comparison with Average as per the required KPI's. 

### ●  Dashboard/report deployment:
The report was then published to Power BI Service.

 #### ● Insights generation:

A 4 page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service.

- Following inferences can be drawn from the Performance analysis dashboard:

Sales YoY : A 24.46% change in year-over-year (YoY) sales revenue has been noted which indicates that there has been a significant increase in sales compared to the same period last year. This suggests strong growth in demand, effective marketing, or successful product launches.

However, a -4.67% change in year-to-date (YTD) sales indicates a slight decline in sales compared to the previous year up to this point in the current year. This could suggest that while the company experienced a strong year-over-year performance, recent trends show a slowdown or potential challenges in maintaining that momentum. This could involve examining recent trends, customer feedback, or market conditions that might be affecting current performance.

Trend of Sales with GP%, EBITDA% and PAT% : The progression from gross profit to EBITDA to PAT each year shows effective cost management at various levels. The decrease from GP to EBITDA to PAT is expected, but the margins suggest that the company is maintaining healthy profitability throughout. The gap between GP and EBITDA indicates that operating expenses (including selling, general, and administrative expenses) are manageable but should be monitored to ensure they don't erode profitability further.
If these margins are consistent over time, they indicate a sustainable business model. However, fluctuations in any of these margins could signal potential issues in sales, cost control, or market conditions.

Sales by Channel and Location: Direct Sales channel has the highest revenue followed by Bulk Sales in UP , Maharashtra & Gujrat. Mfg Sales generates the least amount of revenue in Gujrat.
Location wise Karnataka, Calcutta and Tamil Nadu ae the lowest revenue drawing cities. However the YoY sales and high margins of EBITDA%, GP% and PAT% suggests that the company is managing its costs well and is likely operating in a favorable market environment in Tamil Nadu and Calcutta. Consistent profitability and strong margins suggest a potentially strong market position or brand loyalty for business growth and expansion.

Sales by Category: Protein Pack is the best seller across all States and is drawing in good revenue for the business.

- Following inferences can be drawn from the Cost analysis dashboard:

Raw materials contribute to the highest expenses incurred by the company followed by Trade and Discount.

Year on year raw material to sales ratio for the all the years has been lower than the sales revenue for that year except for the year 2024 where the CY sales is 110m and the raw material to sales ratio is 50.17% indicates that a significant portion of sales revenue has been used to cover the costs of raw materials. A ratio above 50% suggests that raw material costs are high relative to sales, which could affect overall profitability. A high raw materials to sales ratio implies potential inefficiencies in production processes, such as waste or excessive inventory costs for that particular year. It may warrant a closer look at how materials are sourced and utilized.

The operating cost incurred on Protein pack is highest and the Non operating cost incurred is highest for country fries. Operating Cost is highest in the state of UP, Non-Operating Cost is highest in the state of Rajasthan.

- Following inferences can be drawn from the Budget analysis dashboard:

An overall budget variance of -1.91% indicates that actual performance is 1.91% below what was planned or budgeted. This warrants for a closer examination of financial performance to understand the underlying reasons. Identifying and addressing the causes of this variance is crucial for improving future budgeting accuracy and overall financial health. 
The State of UP has been an under-performing since the last few years and has a high budget variance. Rajasthan has been performing well over the past years and outperformed the budgeted sales with current year sales are higher than budgeted, reflecting a strong market demand & effective sales strategies. Looking at the budgeted variance across the states the business may need to make strategic adjustments. This could involve scaling operations up or down, revisiting marketing strategies, or reallocating resources.

The YoY Sales revenue % change by product is the highest for RUSKS. Although the sales is consistently high for Chicken, the change in sales revenue YoY is moderate and lowest is for foul plain overall.

Budgeted Sales has overall been more than the actual sales. Management needs to reassess their strategies, since the budgeted sales are not being met, it might require adjusting marketing efforts, exploring new sales channels, or enhancing product offerings. A variance between budgeted and actual sales necessitates a performance review to understand the reasons behind the lower sales. Analyzing sales data, market trends, and customer feedback can provide insights.

Sales trend with Forecast has been added to display the sales trend in coming years which shows that sales will be fairly moderate in next 1 year.

- Following inferences can be drawn from the Business optimization dashboard:
The Marimekko chart displays that although the sales is highest for Protein packs accounting for 40% of the sales revenue, Fresh Fare which accounts for 14% of the sales has more sku's than the protein pack.While The data suggests a solid revenue base from protein packs, Fresh Fare presents opportunities for diversification and growth. Balancing the strengths of high-revenue products with the potential of diverse offerings will be key to strategic planning and revenue enhancement. Diversifying the other categories of food product will lead to an exponential growth and hold in the market.

Top Category by GP and Net Revenue is Protein Pack followed by Country Fries, Crunch and Munch and Fresh Fare.

Frosty Veggies with Less volume is the one category with the highest Gross Profit. The data suggests that while Frosty Veggies has a strong gross profit margin, its low volume limits its overall revenue potential. The low volume suggests limited market penetration or a niche market. But even with a high margin, the total revenue might not be substantial due to the low sales volume. So focusing on niche marketing and possibly expanding the product line or distribution channels to increase sales volume may help with preserving margin.
